    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      These various rules apply within the LL Discord Server, and also to the Minecraft Servers hosted at ja4.org.
    </p>

      This document is intended to help you along by setting some guidelines. If there's ever concern or ambiguity, it's best to contact Jared D. (the owner). Contact information is located at the bottom of this document.
    </p>
    <h3>General Guidelines</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      Most of this is common sense guidelines for social interactions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't be rude or annoying to other people (this includes unwelcome pings)</li>
      <li>Do not encourage illegal or unethical activities on the server or elsewhere</li>
      <li>Listen to the requests of the administrators</li>
      <li>YouTubers and other streamers are allowed to stream/record the server, so long as they notify players online at the time before they begin the stream/recording. (an @here is sufficient, for example, <span class="code" style="background: #FBF">Hey @here, just an FYI that I'm about to start a YouTube stream at XYZ channel.</span>)</li>
      <li>Server advertising isn't prohibited, however advertising cracked or illegal servers will get an instant ban.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Minecraft-specific Guidelines</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      This section is a bit more specific. This section regards playing on the Minecraft server.
    </p>
    <ul>

      <li>Do not modify other's builds without prior permission</li>
      <li>Don't use cracked clients, we WILL find out - <b>instant ban</b></li>
      <li>Don't claim you're going to "hack the server"</li>
      <li>Client side mods ARE allowed - things like Optifine, Journeymap (including cave mode), mouse tweaks, etc. The packs only include the essential mods required for connecting to the servers</li>
    </ul>
