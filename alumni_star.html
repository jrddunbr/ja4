Please note that while there are some "redacted" segments here, they are not actually confidential statements.

I intend it to be a little tongue-in-cheek fun given the fact that I live in Virginia, not far from Washington, DC.
I am using it simply because I don't want to reveal certain info the public, because that may reveal things such as
current residential address, phone, and other information that I don't really want to share beyond the audience for
this page, which is the students, faculty, and alumni of Clarkson University.

The sections of code that are "redacted" are filled in with JavaScript from a Lambda behind an API Gateway that has
a simple IP address filter on it. Pretty nifty, eh? Maybe I'll release the code sometime.

        <h3>Previous Shenanigans</h3>
        <p class="indent">
            I was a systems administrator, network administrator, and generally a person who did all sorts of random
            server room things between Fall 2015 and Spring 2019, regularly taking 2+ credits of MP* and notably
            including the following various projects and accomplishments:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Setting up the new (at the time) TP Link managed switches with VLAN tags (spring 2017) </li>
            <li>Arranging for the purchase of 10G fiber network hardware as part of an upgrade (spring 2017) </li>
            <li>Getting the labs connected with 10G fiber to the rest of campus by working with OIT (fall 2017) </li>
            <li>Rewired all the patch panels in the ITL and configured for a hackathon setting (fall 2018)</li>
            <li>Coordinating with OIT to get COSI a rack in the Colo space (temperature controlled) (spring 2019) </li>
            <li>Managing VM hosts and provisioning VM's and such </li>
            <li>Maintaining the game server (GMx), voip server, docs, Gogs, Gitea, honeypots ... too many VM's to mention. </li>
            <li>Worked with Bobby Newman to operate Ziltoid (the firewall) and Mirror. </li>
            <li>Lots of relatively exhaustive documentation, network maps, design plans, late nights, etc.</li>
            <li>Cleaned the labs more than once including extensive carpet cleaning (ask about Liquid Ass)</li>
        </ul>
