    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      Congratulations! You have become an admin! This grants you various rights to the LL Discord Server, and also to the Minecraft Servers hosted at ja4.org.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      This document is intended to help you along by setting some guidelines. If there's ever concern or ambiguity, it's best to contact Jared D. (the owner). Contact information is located at the bottom of this document.
    </p>
    <h3>General Guidelines</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      Most of this is common sense guidelines for social interactions, but if you want something more clear cut, feel free to read this section.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If players are being rude or inappropriate, you give them two warnings (for example, "@user, this is your X warning - Please do not do X ..."). The third action is a ban, and you do not warn them of that when you do it. Generally speaking, it's best that Jared does the ban.</li>
      <li>If there is a disagreement between you and a player, involve Jared immediately. If things go out of control, kick the user, and then ban them if they come back. Don't delete messages unless they are particularly terrible (but do log them somewhere).</li>
      <li>Be humble and respectful when acting on behalf of the server. (ex, instead of "HEY STOP DOING X", one can say "Can you please not do X, it is disruptive to the other players. Thank you.")</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Minecraft-specific Guidelines</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      This section is a bit more important. This regards operations of the server, and certain tools can cause damage if used incorrectly.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>On modded Minecraft servers, please DO NOT use WorldEdit on complex tile-entities. This includes Electrical Age - if you try to use WorldEdit on these, it will corrupt the world immediately - you MUSt contact Jared D. immediately if this occurs, to prevent damage to the world.</li>
      <li>On modded Minecraft servers, please do not use the <span class="code">//set</span> command near Electrical Age blocks/cables/etc. Instead, use <span class="code">//replacenear</span>, <span class="code">//replace</span> or <span class="code">//fill</span> (as examples - there are other commands that are "safe" like this and don't replace blocks other than air or a specific block).</li>
      <li>Please don't cheat stuff for yourself or others. Exceptions to this rule may be made.</li>
      <li>Do not give/take op permissions, or you will be penalized.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Contact Information</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      The best way to contact Jared is by emailing
